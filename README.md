#Bioinformatics Project

##Project description:

+ Working under the supervision of Prof. Humberto Ortiz Zuazaga, Ricardo Betancourt,
     and Dahiana Arcila I'm currently trying to find Diferential Expressions from different 
     species of cave fishes through data obtained from transcriptomics.

###Scripts & Results:

  1. Trinity Scripts ---// First few Trinity draft scripts to start assembly on some cave fish files (tread lightly).
  2. SRA Scripts -----// Draft scripts to download cave & surface fish data from SRA to assemble (also tread lightly).
  3. Coming Soon --// (Updates every week)
